## About Me
I'm a 1st year software engineering Masters student at LUT-University, with a strong interest in programming and software development. I am familiar with many languages, tools and frameworks and I have a long-standing background in computers as a hobby. I am most experienced with web development and server administration, but I am eager to expand my skill set into other areas as well. Outside of programming, I am a home automation and 3D printing hobbyist, and you can regularly find me at the gym.

- **IoT and home automation:** Home Assistant | ESPHome | MQTT
- **Tools:** Git | GitHub | VS Code | Android Studio | Fusion 360

## Other projects
### Home automation and homelabbing
My home automation started off a couple of years back virtualising a Home Assistant OS on an old office computer running Fedora server. I was able to dip my hands into home automation and server maintenance with this setup executing things such as fully automated smart lighting, smart home assisted morning and evening routines and virtualising other small projects such as [LedFx](https://github.com/LedFx/LedFx). This allowed me to gain experience tinkering with Wi-Fi and Zigbee based devices and general automation and networking.

Since then, I have gradually upgraded to a multi-node, multi-site setup running mostly Proxmox and Ubuntu. This has expanded my possibilities greatly, for example allowing to host distributed web apps, building threat models and firewalls and practicing ingress and egress control.

### 3D printing
I have a heavily customized Ender 3 V2, with mods such as direct drive hotend, automatic bed leveling and filament runout sensor. I am running a custom firmware based on [mriscoc's professional firmware](https://github.com/mriscoc/Ender3V2S1), of which my version can be found here: [https://github.com/RoniSeppala/Ender3V2S1](https://github.com/RoniSeppala/Ender3V2S1). 3D printing also pairs well with home automation, as I am able to build fully custom projects with 3D printed parts designed in Fusion 360 in addition to simple microcontrollers such as the ESP32.
