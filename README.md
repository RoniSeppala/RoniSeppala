## About Me
I'm a 1st year Software Engineering Master's student at LUT-University with an interest in backend and system administration. My main strengths revolve around my hands-on experience with self-hosting and thus include backend work, Linux server administration, virtualization and networking. I value clean interfaces and enjoy solving real operational problems when taking a project from idea to deployment.

- **Infra and Networking:** Linux | Nginx | Proxmox | KVM | LXC | WireGuard | TLS
- **IoT and home automation:** Home Assistant | ESPHome | MQTT
- **Tools:** Git | GitHub | VS Code | Android Studio | Fusion 360

## Other projects
### Home automation and homelabbing
My home automation started off a couple of years back virtualising a Home Assistant OS on an old office computer running Fedora server. I was able to dip my hands into home automation and server maintenance with this setup executing things such as fully automated smart lighting, smart home assisted morning and evening routines and virtualising other small projects such as [LedFx](https://github.com/LedFx/LedFx). This allowed me to gain experience tinkering with Wi-Fi and Zigbee based devices and general automation and networking.

Since then, I have gradually upgraded to a multi-node, multi-site setup running mostly Proxmox and Ubuntu. This has expanded my possibilities greatly, for example allowing to host distributed web apps, building threat models and firewalls and practicing ingress and egress control.

### 3D printing
I have a heavily customized Ender 3 V2, with mods such as direct drive hotend, automatic bed leveling and filament runout sensor. I am running a custom firmware based on [mriscoc's professional firmware](https://github.com/mriscoc/Ender3V2S1), of which my version can be found here: [https://github.com/RoniSeppala/Ender3V2S1](https://github.com/RoniSeppala/Ender3V2S1). 3D printing also pairs well with home automation, as I am able to build fully custom projects with 3D printed parts designed in Fusion 360 in addition to simple microcontrollers such as the ESP32.
