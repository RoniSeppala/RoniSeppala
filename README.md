## About Me

I'm a 3rd year software engineering student at LUT-university, with a strong intrest in programming and software development. I am familiar with many languages, tools and frameworks and I have a long background with comptuers as a hobby. I am most experienced with web development, but I am eager to expand my skill-set further in other areas as well. Outside of programming I am a home automation and 3d printing hobbyist as well as a regular at the gym.

## Other projects

### Home automation
I have been running an instance of Home Assistant for a couple of years now. I have an old low power office desktop running fedora linux server where I have Home Assistant running on a virtual machine. I have done multiple projects automating my life with it such as automatic curtains made with a motor and a ESP32 microcontroller as well as nearly fully automated smart ligths using Wi-Fi and Zigbee. My future plans include upgrading the server hardware and switching to operating systems such as Proxmox or TrueNAS in addition to projects automating my life further.

### 3d printing
I have a heavily customized Ender 3 v2, with mods such as direct drive hot-end, automatic bed leveling and filament runout sensor. 3d printing pairs well as a hobby to home automation, as I am able to build fully custom projects with 3d printed parts designed in Fusion 360 in addition to simple microcontrollers such as the ESP32.
