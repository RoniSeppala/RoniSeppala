## About Me

I'm a 3rd year software engineering student at LUT-University, with a strong interest in programming and software development. I am familiar with many languages, tools and frameworks and I have a long-standing background in computers as a hobby. I am most experienced with web development, but I am eager to expand my skill set into other areas as well. Outside of programming, I am a home automation and 3D printing hobbyist and you can regularly find me at the gym.

## Other projects

### Home automation
I have been running Home Assistant for a couple of years. "I have an old low-power office desktop running Fedora Linux Server where I have Home Assistant running on a virtual machine. I have done multiple projects automating my life with it such as automatic curtains made with a motor and an ESP32 microcontroller as well as nearly fully automated smart lights using Wi-Fi and Zigbee. My future plans include upgrading the server hardware and switching to Proxmox or TrueNAS for improved virtualization and storage management in addition to projects automating my life further.

### 3D printing
I have a heavily customized Ender 3 v2, with mods such as direct drive hot-end, automatic bed leveling and filament runout sensor. 3D printing pairs well with home automation, as I am able to build fully custom projects with 3D printed parts designed in Fusion 360 in addition to simple microcontrollers such as the ESP32.
